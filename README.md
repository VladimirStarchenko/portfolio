# About Me

My name is Vladimir Starchenko. I'm 19 years old and just recently graduated University of Toronto's coding bootcamp. I'm always looking for an oppurtunity to learn and gain experience. I love to be able to use my skills to help people out whether it's a fellow coder or maybe even a business owner. It brings me joy bringing smiles to people's faces.
