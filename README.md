Easy to Navigate my personal website has a sleek and modern look as do many of my other web applications. I apply the same level of effort to work and personal projects. 


### About Me

My name is Vladimir Starchenko. I'm 19 years old and just recently graduated University of Toronto's coding bootcamp. I'm always looking for an oppurtunity to learn and gain experience. I love to be able to use my skills to help people out whether it's a fellow coder or maybe even a business owner. It brings me joy bringing smiles to people's faces. This information as well as my applicable job skills are located on this page, along with my resume that you can view or download ‚ò∫

### Projects

Here are some of my personal and group bootcamp projects that you can feel free to look at. The Github as well as a little description of the project and it's functionality is below every screenshot. Don't be fooled by the modesty of these projects. I'm constantly working on more to add to this page. If you see one you would like to collaborate on or contact me about the next page is there just for that reason.
